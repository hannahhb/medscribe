# medscribe: Scribe for Patient Appointments

## Project Overview

It stores transcription results alongside additional consultation notes in a SQLite database, making it easier‚è∞ for healthcare providers to manage and review patient consultationsüò∑. Tested on MacBook Pro M3 Chip Ô£ø

Make sure to install the LLM GGUF Optimised model and place it in a new directory models/ \
You can pick any GGUF and change path in server/llm_local.py
Initially I've used [Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/bartowski/Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410-GGUF) for testing.
