Patient: I’ve had lower back pain for about two weeks, and sometimes the pain shoots down my right leg. Doctor: Does it get worse when you sit or stand? Patient: Sitting for a long time aggravates it, while walking around seems to help somewhat. Doctor: Any numbness or tingling in the foot? Patient: Occasionally, yes, with a tingling sensation down to my big toe. Doctor: Have you tried any treatments so far? Patient: Just over-the-counter pain relievers and a heating pad.",
        "doctor_notes": "Mr. Garcia, 39, presents with a two-week history of lower back pain radiating down the right leg, consistent with sciatica symptoms. Prolonged sitting worsens his pain; mild relief is found on movement. He experiences intermittent tingling from the right calf to the toe, and has tried OTC analgesics and heating pads with partial relief. A disc-related or nerve compression etiology is suspected."
